A binary tree is a type of data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This structure allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data.

Key Characteristics
1. Root Node: The topmost node in the tree, which serves as the starting point for traversal.
2. Left Child: The node that is to the left of a given node.
3. Right Child: The node that is to the right of a given node.
4. Leaf Node: A node with no children.

Types of Binary Trees
1. Full Binary Tree: A tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.
2. Empty Binary Tree: A tree with no nodes.
3. Perfect Binary Tree: A tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.

Binary Tree Traversal
There are three main types of binary tree traversal:

1. Inorder Traversal: Left subtree -> Root -> Right subtree
2. Preorder Traversal: Root -> Left subtree -> Right subtree
3. Postorder Traversal: Left subtree -> Right subtree -> Root
