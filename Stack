A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

Key Characteristics
1. Last-In-First-Out (LIFO): The last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.
2. Elements are added and removed from the top: Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.
3. Access is limited to the top element: Only the top element of the stack can be accessed directly.

Basic Operations
1. Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. Pop: Removes the top element from the stack.
3. Peek: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
4. IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.

Types of Stacks
1. Array-Based Stack: Implemented using an array, where the top element is tracked using an index.
2. Linked List-Based Stack: Implemented using a linked list, where the top element is the head of the list.

Advantages
1. Efficient insertion and deletion: Stacks allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at the top.
2. Simple implementation: Stacks are relatively simple to implement, especially using arrays.

Disadvantages
1. Limited access: Only the top element of the stack can be accessed directly.
2. Not suitable for random access: Stacks are not suitable for applications that require random access to elements.

Applications
1. Evaluating postfix expressions: Stacks can be used to evaluate postfix expressions.
2. Implementing recursive algorithms: Stacks can be used to implement recursive algorithms iteratively.
3. Parsing syntax: Stacks can be used to parse syntax in programming languages.
4. Undo/Redo functionality: Stacks can be used to implement undo/redo functionality in applications.

Real-World Examples
1. Browser history: Web browsers use a stack to store the history of pages visited.
2. Undo/Redo in text editors: Text editors use a stack to implement undo/redo functionality.
3. Parser in compilers: Compilers use a stack to parse the syntax of programming languages.
